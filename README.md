##Introduction

Gathering information about our climate is one of the most pressing issues of our time, which is why international organizations have been setting up satellites and capturing real-time images of the atmospheric conditions on Earth. However, in order to give a truly comprehensive view of the changes occurring to the Earthâ€™s climate, it has become necessary to have one platform on which the information from all those different data sources can be brought together, and displayed accurately in 3D. It is also desired to allow any user to interactively view past, present, and future weather information. Built upon NASA World Wind, NASA World Weather is the first web application to ever display such a broad range of weather and other global spatial data viewed together in 3D. This gives the user a great customizable experience that can be utilized by weather forecasters, research scientists studying climate change, and even intrigued enthusiasts.

##Data Sources

**NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS):** global, full-resolution satellite imagery from different NASA data providers. GIBS provides quick access to almost 200 satellite imagery products, covering every part of the world. Most imagery is available with a few hours after satellite overpass and some products span over 15 years. In total, there are over 240 trillion pixels' worth of imagery available to be rendered in your own web client or GIS application.

**ESA SENTINEL:** data from the European Space Agency with focus on Earth observation in three aspects; Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Land monitoring. The goal of the SENTINEL program is to replace the current older Earth observation missions which have reached retirement, such as the ERS mission, or are currently nearing the end of their operational life span. This will ensure a continuity of data so that there are no gaps in ongoing studies.

**NASA Earth Observations (NEO):** a source of satellite imagery as well as different scientific information that is related to the climate and the environment. NEO's mission is to help users picture climate and environmental changes as they occur on our home planet. Over 50 different global datasets are represented with daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots, and images are available in a variety of formats.

**NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS):** a weather forecast model created by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). It makes available multiple atmospheric and land-soil variables, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration.

**European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ESMWF):** the world's largest archive of numerical weather prediction data provided by most of the nations of Europe through this independent intergovernmental organisation. ECMWF, through its partnerships with EUMETSAT, ESA, the EU and the European Science community has established a leading position for Europe in the exploitation of satellite data for operational numerical weather prediction, and for operational seasonal forecasting with coupled atmosphere-ocean-land models.

**Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) GeoMet:** raw numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data layers and the weather radar mosaic. GeoMet provides access to the Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) raw numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data layers and the weather radar mosaic. The GeoMet service is aimed at specialized users with good meteorological and information technology knowledge that want to visualize raw NWP models and the weather radar mosaic layers
